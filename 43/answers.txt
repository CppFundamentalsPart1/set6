In String's interface two at members are declared.
    1. Why?

        Because a member for const objects is needed too.

    2. Which one is used in the abovementioned main function?

        Since strings is not const

            std::string &at(size_t idx);

        is used.

    3. Provide a small (!) example showing a situation where the other at member is used.

        void foo(Strings const &strings)
        {
            cout << strings.at(0) << '\n';
        }
