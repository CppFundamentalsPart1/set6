Modify the class CharCount (from exercise 35) such that
    1. Starting from an initial capacity 8 for storing Char objects the capacity is doubled whenever the current capacity is exhausted.
    2. An array of pointers to members is used to immediately determine which function to call once its required action has been determined.
